# Building Machine Learning Systems with a Feature Store

This project is based on the O'Reilly book "Building Machine Learning Systems with a Feature Store: Batch, Real-Time, and LLMs". It provides examples and tutorials on how to build and deploy machine learning systems using feature stores.

## ML System Examples

Explore the dashboards for example ML systems [here](https://amomozzz.github.io/mlfs-book/).

For air quality prediction, hereâ€™s another example where all predictions are generated using a single model. [here](https://amomozzz.github.io/mlfs-book/).
